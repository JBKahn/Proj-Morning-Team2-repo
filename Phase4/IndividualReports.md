# Individual Reports

## LLay

 * My most significant contributions were the django models for the usage of calendar/user information.
 * I have learned a great deal about Angular, Django, grunt and all the other technologies we employed in our project. I learned a great deal about development evironments and how large projects are developed using github. 
 * I didn't know any of the technologies we were using. I was not prepared for a prject of this size. 
 * I do my best. I provide moral support.

## Joseph Kahn (JBKahn)

 * My most significant contribution was the implementation of the behaviour and design of the angular frontend application as well as some of the [backend server code to handle those calls on our side](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/pull/13/files#diff-51dd35e87aa8f465594ce1af3ea1fd12R125) and [send them to google](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/commit/527950438cdb215ad73ed2063f3919cb015f01e0#diff-189655e2e52c208eaf27ba53364e80e1). [Here's](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/tree/master/AbArticulus/time_table/static_src) where most of that frontend code was contained. Some of it required some intresting work including extending unfinished third party libraries as seen [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/commit/95832d117a677ac66ce8b4647881e5b1f7879518#diff-1f952f9b9a806d2197e773f259707a17) where I added the error spec from the [material design guidlines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/errors.html).
 * While working on our webapp I learned a bit more about Oauth2 and how the handshake process worked. In addition to that I learned how refresh tokens work when adding them [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/commit/a1ce81e3bc80ca132465aa4b6c409f9ed138ce9e#diff-d3122f77e6f8cad3e0be4b2a2c11bebbR26) and how to parse and use the large set of [Google Clanedar API docs](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/).
 * I am always helping my teammates with discussions and code reviews - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used through a two hour demo as well as question and answer session. I talked about the full stack and some of the tools I talked about were Django and our usage of [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/master/AbArticulus/todo/views.py) as well as our usage of [Grunt](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/master/AbArticulus/todo/Gruntfile.js) and simple Angular [Controllers](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/master/AbArticulus/todo/static_src/js/controllers/ngTodoCtrl.js), [templates](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/master/AbArticulus/todo/static_src/templates/todoApp.html) and [services](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/master/AbArticulus/todo/static_src/js/services/todoService.js).
 * I tended to take the `if you want it done right, do it yourself` mentality. I spent a lot of time on code reviews (e.g. [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/pull/5) and [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/pull/7)) which could have been more productively used pair programming to better help on-board my team in the skills and conventions of our stack. In the end, I sent a tutorial or two and pointed people to docs but, aside from the demo, I could have been a better teacher of the skills I knew.

## Michelle Bianca Data (mdata2)

* My most significant contribution was webscraping the uoft timetable so that our application can support adding the info into our db and then auto population of courses instead of manually typing and setting up the times etc in their own personal calendar. My contribution was mainly on the backend side. [command](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/web-scraping-timetable/AbArticulus/abcalendar/management/commands/webscraper.py)

* While working on our application, I have learned working on the backend (i.e setting up databases or models), a bit of frontend work and how powerful the MVC mode is through the guidance of my team members, and code reviewing their work.

* Code reviewing is mandatory throughout our project journey. I have a little background on both backend and frontend during the whole phase. However, I participated on code reviewing each others work and helped proof read most of our written reports.

* We had a gatekeeper who is always monitoring the merges, we had little issues on merging branches. Nobody is allowed to merge until their work has been code reviewed. I made a few commits on my webscraping branch to fix up the code for efficiency, readability as adviced by my team members.[webscraping branch] (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/pull/7)

## Taras Gordiyenko

 * backend api wrappers for google calendar event creation calls [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/pull/10/files)
 * Grunt usage to split up CSS files. AngularJS and all that entailed, seperate URL routing over the core application, JS library wrapping, serialization/deserialization of objects between Angular and Django.
 * Presentation and writing skills
 * Avaliability, as the semester ramped up, I got swamped and had trouble finding time to set aside for this project

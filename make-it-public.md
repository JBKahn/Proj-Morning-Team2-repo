Before any user adds their name I just want to make a few things we agreed upon clear.

1) All phase materials, including bios, is ok with all of us to be released.

2) The credentials stored in [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team2-repo/blob/master/AbArticulus/mysite/common.py) are all resting credentials. The only ones that can used for anything outside the application are for a `testing` gmail account. That account belongs to one of us and is already publicially available in another repository since it just used to test send emails to ensure that it's setup correctly. All other credentials used involved using environment variables. With the exception of the API credentials which are a seperate set than those used in production. The testing credentials have also been revoked.

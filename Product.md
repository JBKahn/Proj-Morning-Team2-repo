Abarticulus is a collaborative, student-focused, personal organiser that minimizes the effort required in maintaining your school schedule. With other personal organisers and calendars, there's a large barrier of entry in the form of the effort it takes to manually enter all of your lectures, deadlines and recurring commitments to get started. The way we solved this was by leveraging the fact that classrooms have dozens, if not hundreds of students with near-identical schedules and commitments. It only takes one person to update information for everyone else to benefit.

Minimization of effort was foremost in our minds during the design of Abarticulus, this can be seen in our first set of deliverables. To simplify set-up we allow users to enter their U of T course codes and have the application populate the recurring times of their lectures and course deadlines automatically. Since we don't expect proffessors to be involved, we implemented a simple voting system to allow students to work together in keeping deadlines and project details accurate. To make the application as accessible as possible, we made it a webapp accessible from any modern browser. Lastly, to avoid having our users duplicate work they've already done, we import their existing Google Calendar events during sign up. All this is wrapped in straightforward calendar UI we're rapidly adding features to.

Abarticulus is there to help you avoid moments of crisis.
